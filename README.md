# Bachelor's thesis research using R

**Main objective is to explore whether hedging with financial derivatives has a statistically significant difference on S&P500 industrial companies' market value**

### Sample:
The research sample consists of S&P 500 industrial companies. From the initially selected group of 61 companies, after filtering for properly presented data, 488 financial statements were analyzed over an 8-year period, and data were ultimately collected for 51 companies covering the years 2015–2022.

### Used models:

## Null Hypothesis
**H₀: The use of derivatives has a statistically significant effect on the Tobin’s Q value of industrial companies.**

## Results
- Companies in the S&P 500 industrial sector mostly choose to hedge against foreign exchange rate risk, followed by interest rate risk and commodity price risk.
- Descriptive statistics indicate that companies using derivatives are larger, have a higher liquidity ratio, and a lower capital expenditure ratio.
- For analyzing the panel data, a fixed effects model was chosen with robust standard errors that account for heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation.
- The profitability indicator has the greatest positive effect on Tobin’s Q, while the capital expenditure ratio has the greatest negative effect.

## Conclusions
- Derivatives provide an opportunity to manage market risk, but this tool must be used for hedging purposes, and the risk taken must be significant.
- Based on the regression analysis conducted, it was found that for S&P 500 industrial companies, the use of derivatives for hedging market risk does not have a statistically significant effect on Tobin’s Q.

## Limitations
- This study examines only the group of S&P 500 industrial companies; therefore, these results should not be generalized to all company groups. It is important to continue studying this topic in different regions of the world and across various industry sectors, with a focus on the effectiveness of risk management.
- The effect may be indirect or revealed using other methods or in other sectors.
